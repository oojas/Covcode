## Problem Statement:
Looking at the current situation of India, COVID has really given us one blow of a lifetime. Lakhs of people are trying to find resources to fight the pandemic but they are facing a hard time putting their hands on them. Major deaths in the country are due to either shortage of the resources or non-availability. Many people died because they were not exposed to the resources in their state in time as they were'nt aware of them. The country needs a platform that is a collection of verified sources of every state.

## My solution:
So I made a website that has a collection of all the verified resources of COVID in every state and can also provide the basic guidelines on how to fight COVID. It proves to be a one stop platform g
The resources that my website will have includes :
1. Oxygen availability , Beds availability and medicines in a particular state
2. Live tracking of available beds in your area in hospitals
3. Watsapp/telegram groups of every state regarding covid resources.
4. Plasma donoating and requesting. 
5. COVID stats tracker
6. Only Good News as we have so much negativity during these rough times
7. Vaccination registeration guide.
8. How to be safe at home

Since resources are available on twitter or on various platforms but are not clubbed and are scattered and there is a void of a platform where all the resources are clubbed, my website will be a platform of clubbing all the info about available verified resources in every state and country.

## Technologies Used :
1. Flutter 
2. HTML
3. Javascrpipt

## Special Features :
Since the website is built on flutter framework it can not only be used as an app on android but also on IOS with the same code base as flutter provides cross-network platform which helps in building for both android and IOS.
The website has been deployed on netlify.

## Future Prospects
1. Making it completely dynamic , my further motivation would be to open a platform where people can also enter the verified.
2. Making my own REST API for includiing daily testing of covid statistics
